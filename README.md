# Problem Description: 
* There is a Human Resource company, which is going to hire a new candidate. 
* The candidate has told his previous salary 160K per annum as regional manager, and the HR have to check whether he is telling the truth or bluff. 
* So to identify this, they only have a dataset of his previous company in which the salaries of the top 10 positions are mentioned with their levels.
* By checking the dataset available, we have found that there is a non-linear relationship between the Position levels and the salaries.
* Our goal is to build a Bluffing detector regression model, so HR can hire an honest candidate. 
* Here we will predict the output for level 6.5 because the candidate has 4+ years' experience as a regional manager, so he must be somewhere between levels 7 and 6.
